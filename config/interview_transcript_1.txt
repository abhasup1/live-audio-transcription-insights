AW: Hello again, Mike. It's lovely to see you again. This is the second part of the interview process. We shouldn't take too long, as I know you have an appointment later today.

MB: It's nice to see you too. Thanks, that'd be great.

AW: Fantastic. I wanted to ask you about your previous role at Farnsborough Retail. It says on your CV that you were promoted to the position of sales manager. Could you tell me a little bit more about that?

MB: Of course. I started off as a sales assistant and worked my way up. Within two years, I was promoted to sales manager thanks to my performance.

AW: That's impressive. What was it about your performance that got you the promotion?

MB: Well, I managed to consistently set new records in sales with an increase of 20% yearly. They asked if I could take my approach and make similar increases happen at a higher level, and I said yes.

AW: And did you?

MB: Yes, indeed. By the end of my first year as sales manager, we saw an increase of 15%.

AW: That's very impressive, Mike...

[Knock on the door]

AW: Sorry, Mike. Come in. Ah, here's our tea. Thank you very much.

BB: [inaudible]

AW: No, thanks. Thanks for bringing the tea.
